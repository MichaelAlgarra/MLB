# MLB Analyses
I've always been a huge MLB fan. I've been a Phillies fan since I was in grade school.  
Being able to combine two of my main interests, being programming and baseball, is very fun for me!  

These programs are statistical analyses using pybaseball and baseballr, from [jldbc](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) and [BillPetti](https://github.com/billpetti/baseballr) respectively
